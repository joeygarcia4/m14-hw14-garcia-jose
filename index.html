        <p>At the moment, I'm doing pretty well in public sector marketing and communications, and have moved up from a lowly part-timer to manager in just a couple of years. I always have the option to stay on this path and keep climbing the ladder, but I've also been interested in pivoting to the agency/consulting side of public sector comm's, or even jumping to private sector as a business-to-government (B2G, as opposed to B2B) marketer. Who knows what the future holds.</p>

          <li>Improve my web design skills</li>
